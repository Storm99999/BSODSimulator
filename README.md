# BSODSimulator
This is a rewritten version of github.com/FlyTechVideos/BluescreenSimulator.
I remade it cause the old UI was boring and I made it more modern, also made it in simplier code (Easier to understand).


# How To Use
* Open The .exe File And Enter Some funi text inside the boxes and click Give Me A BSOD!
